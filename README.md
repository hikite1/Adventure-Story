Alaundo's Prophecy
This is set in the D&D 3.5 campaign setting. A player can choose between different home worlds, classes, and races. Based on player choices they will have differnet story lines. There is one battle for the adventurers accepting the challenge. The story concludes in Baldur's Gate. 

Errors
None known that crash the story. Battle functions need work. Player can run away and continue story to the end.

In Development
battle functions, specifically to allow hero to roll an attack against the monster. Right now the monster just attacks the hero and does damage to the hero. 

Deploy the project so everyone can play it, HTML python terminal? web app?

Future Ideas
add feats, skill, combat actions, spells, size modifiers, intiative rolls, and saving throws
